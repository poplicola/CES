# B2C and Social Track
This track is for folks creating and sustaining small business efforts in CES.

## Stats to get started
I received these statistics resources from Ben Worth at the local chamber. This is a good starting point to understand businesses that might thrive in the area. Ben also wrote:

> Q: What do you think drives businesses to thrive in this area (Lexington, Rockbridge, etc)?

> A: Our major industries are education, healthcare, and manufacturing.  Also agriculture.  They all have needs for professionals … both technicians and bachelors+ employees.  So, one thing that makes them thrive (but also is a challenge) is a trained workforce.  Also access to education, transportation, and childcare.

> Q: What kind of businesses does the area *want* to attract that it doesn't already?

> A: I also work with Rockbridge Outdoors, which promotes adventure tourism in the area.  **I see this as an opportunity for growth.** (emphasis mine)
